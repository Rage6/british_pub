# "The Hunting Horn"
## *A Mock British Pub*


**Purpose:** I created this website simply to demonstrate some of my design and development skills for a small business.

**Languages:** HTML, CSS, Angular

**Mobile Friendly?:** Yes

Welcome to The Hunting Horn! This website is built from scratch (no frameworks present) and displays my use of the "one-page" style. This style has been very popular for small-scale businesses, organizations, or individuals trying to easily present themselves to users.

**CSS:** As mentioned, this website and it's CSS ('views/style.css') was built entirely from scratch rather than using a framework like Bootstrap. Within the sections like "News & Events" and "Drinks", flexbox tools are used to adapt the content to the user's browser width. Finally, this site was originally structured for mobile devices. However, the lower portion of the CSS file (starting around line 434) utilizes the '@media' tool to adjust particular classes/ids when they are used on a laptop-sized screen.

**Angular:** To minimize clutter without losing important information, this website needed to utilize some form of Javascript. This allowed me to design a site in which users could select only their interests (drinks, menu, etc.) rather than scrolling through entire pages or hopping from on page to the next. In this case, I chose to use Angular language. That language's tools like 'ng-show' were allowed me to simply show or hide the appropriate information with a simple click.
